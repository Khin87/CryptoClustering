# CryptoClustering


The analysis found the same number and composition of clusters (4) when using the original standarized data of 7 series of returns than when using its 3 principal components. These three principal components explained 90% of the variance of the cryptocurrencies' returns.

This code applies K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to cluster cryptocurrencies based on performance over 7 different holding periods.

Technologies used in the analysis are:

Scikit-learn machine learning tools for the unsupervised data analysis. Tools such as Cluster, StandardScaler, Preprocessing and KElbowVisualizer for Kmeans, Data Standarization, and Principal Component Analysis.

Pandas, NumPy and Path libraries for general coding, hvPlot for visualizations
